# Telecom Churn Classification

This repository contains code for building a machine learning model to classify churn for a telecom dataset. Churn prediction is a critical task for telecom companies to understand customer behavior and take proactive measures to retain them.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. 
## Model

The model employed for churn prediction is Logistic Regression. This model is trained on the telecom dataset to predict whether a customer will churn or not. 

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
